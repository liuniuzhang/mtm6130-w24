    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <mark>typesetting</mark> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap <del>into electronic typesetting,</del> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/">1960s</a> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
